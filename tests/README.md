Log Analyzer Tests
==================

This directory provides some examples of commands. They can be runs using a
redirection this way:

    > ./log_analyzer log_file < commands.txt

With `log_file` containing data and `commands.txt` being one of examples from
this directory.

The commands can also be used *by hands*, by copy/pasting the queries on the
command line (with the `-e` flag) or interactively.

Some examples assume a time-range similar to the log provided by the challenge
(not included in this repos).
